<h2>New Techniques</h2>

<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
    
    <p>Next Month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</strong>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
    
    <dd>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</dd>
