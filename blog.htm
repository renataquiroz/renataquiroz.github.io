        <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
        
        <p>posted by BGB, November 15,2012</p>
        
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide.</em> In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <em>Cooking for Greeks,</em> Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching". </p>
        
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide with Dill Hollandise.</strong> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
